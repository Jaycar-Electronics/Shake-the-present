## Software Libraries

For this project you will need to use the arduino library manager to download some libraries:

| Library           | Author                      | Version |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| Sparkfun_MMA8452Q | Sparkfun                    | 1.4.0   |
| U8g2lib           | oliver <olikraus@gmail.com> | 2.27.6  |

## How to create OLED images

Usually it is quicker and easier to first _draw_ the images in MS Paint, as they have the handy shapes and lines that we can use to make the picture how we want.

Edit the file properties so that it is a black and white image of size 128 x 64. For instance, we are going to go with something like this: _(zoom in 800% so it's easier to see while working)_

![mspaint](images/mspaint.jpg)

Once you have made your image, select all ( `Ctrl-A` ) and copy ( `Ctrl-C`) to paste into gimp ( `Ctrl-V` ).

In gimp, there's a few extra tools, such as 360 degree rotation, and other things.

###  Using GIMP

Firstly download and run GIMP.

If you did not create an image with MS paint, you can create a new image of size 128x64 pixels as shown in the picture below:

or otherwise get your image and reduce it in size to 128 x 64 via `Image -> Canvas Size`.

### 1-bit pallet

As the OLED screen we are using only has 1 bit data (ie: on or off) we must change the image mode to be similar 1-bit sized.

Firstly go to `Image -> Mode -> Indexed..` And set the colormap to the `1-bit pallet`

### Exporting as XBM

The filetype we want for the OLED is actually an `XBM` filetype; Go to `File -> Export As` and choose XBM with the _"Select File Type (By Extension)"_

![save as](images/gimp-savec.png)

you can name the file something easy to remember, such as `santa.xbm`

Once you have exported the file as XBM, you can then rename it to `santa.h` file. This is so the arduino IDE can pick it up and include it normally. XBM is an old file format used in the early days of computers which were just straight `C` code, such as what's seen below:
